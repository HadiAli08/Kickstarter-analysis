# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise has created a fundraiser for her play "Fever" which has done very well in fundraising by quickly nearing its goal. Louise now would like us to sort through fundraising Kickstarter data to see how they fared in relation to launch date and their respective goals. The purpose of this project is to not only take the data and interpret it, but to also organize and create visuals to make the data readable and much easier to understand.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After creating a visual line graph correlating Theater outcomes based on launch date (as seen below pic 1), we can see that there is a correlation. When looking at the canceled line, the conclusion can be made that throughout the year, canceled Theater Kickstarters stays very flat and is not very volatile. This same conclusion can be made looking at the failed line, however there is a big more varitation throughout the year with the middle months (May-Aug) having a slight peak in failed outcomes. When looking at the successful line it seems as though it is very static untifl the middle months once again where there is a spike in succesful Theater Kickstarter campaigns which peaks in May and slowly declines until September where it sharply declines into a low in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When analyzing the Outcomes based on Goal line graph we can see trends. First off when looking at the percentage canceled line, plays have no rate of getting canceled at all. There were no play Kickstarters that were canceled and it remained at 0 throughout the different goal categories. When looking at the percentage failed we can see that the line spikes at the 45k-50k with all in this category failing. The most successful category would be Play Kickstarters with goals under 1k and the least succecssful being after 45k.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge that we ran into right away was the data was not properly sorted and was much harder to understand. We had to organize the data to make it much easier to understand and manage saying that the sheet was so large. A difficulty that we could have run into would be getting the data. If the data were to not be something easily attainable we would have to find ways to quickly get this much data and a way to get it sorted without having to spend numerous hours if budget and time were to be an issue.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	Based on the chart we can make a couple of conclusions. First we can conclude that it is very unlikely for Theater Kickstarters to get canceled no matter the time of year it was launched. Another thing we can conclude is that the most successful month to start a Theater Kickstarter is May which is where we see a peak in successful outcomes. 
	
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	One thing that we can conclude about this chart has to do with the success rate with the higher goals. We can conclude that the success rate is not necessarily tied 100% to the goals, however certain goals have higher fail rates. We can conclude that any goals above 45k are the least successful and very unlikely to succeed. Another thing we can conclude is that play Kickstarters are not likely to get cancelled as they have a 0% likelihood of this based on the data. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	There are a couple limitations for this data. A few examples may be limited access to data as this data was provided to us rather than collected. Another could be time constraints as time was an issue it could lead to improper data analysis. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	There are an infinite number of other tables that we could create with this data. A couple options are relate the outcomes to which country it is from to see if certain countries have more successful campaigns. Another would be to relate the outcome to how long the Kickstarter could receive funds.
